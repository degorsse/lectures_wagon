## MVC

### Definitions

* Model
* View
* Controller

### Also

* Repository
* Router

### Faking the web

## Way of working

### Bad

* Everything in the repository
* Then model
* Then controller
* Then view

### Good

* Single functionality (like, list all recipes)
* View for it
* Controller for it
* Model for it

## Useful pieces

### Reading/Writing a CSV file

### Scrapping a page

## Sample

A newsfeed:

* title
* url
